8*8 board
queen always starts on cell of its own color.
White always moves first.

pawn: a pawn can optionally move two squares forward on its first move. It always captures diagonally.
When a pawn reaches the furthest line of the board, 
you must promote it to a *different* piece: rook, bishop, knight or queen.
It doesn't have to be one of your own pieces that's already captured.

Player must move out of check.
Stalemate: neither king is in check, but no other legal move.

Ways to draw (we only handle a couple of them):
- stalemate
- both players agree to a draw
- if the exact same position has repeated three times, either player can claim a draw.
- If 50 moves have occurred without a pawn move or a capture either player can claim a draw.
- neither players have enough pieces to cause checks (e.g. king versus king)
- bunch of other complicated situations

Castling:
- move king two squares, move rook next to king on the other side.
Cannot castle when in check, into check or through a check (where the square skipped by the king is threatened by capture)
Cannot castle if there are any pieces between the king and the rook.
Cannot castle if the king or the rook you're castling with have already moved before; it must be their first move.
Can castle either kingside or queenside.

En Passant:
If your opponent moves a pawn two squares right next to a pawn of yours, then on the next turn AND ONLY THAT TURN, 
you can move your pawn diagonally behind your opponent's pawn and capture it as if it were there.
